Result:

79 passed
```

### Acceptance Assessment

- Role services can claim queued assignments for their own role.
- Role services do not claim assignments for other roles.
- Claimed assignments execute through the safe-output service.
- Successful runs record completed assignment state with run id and terminal tool.
- Invalid worker runs that emit no terminal safe-output mark the claimed assignment failed and preserve the failed run.
- Status snapshot and dashboard expose role assignment counts and current/terminal assignment rows.

### Residual Gaps

These are not blockers for PB-004 Story 1 because the engineering implementation log explicitly leaves them for later PB-004/PB-005 slices:

- No continuous long-running role-service loop yet.
- No lease timeout, claim recovery, or heartbeat refresh yet.
- No hibernation/hydration behavior yet.
- No automatic lifecycle handoff assignment creation yet.
- Prompt, memory, and flow-state context assembly is still represented through assignment payload data.
